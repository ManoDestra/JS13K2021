## Background

You exist on a planet (in a galaxy far, far away...), as one
of a series of clones grown to defend your planet from enemy
attack.

## Design

Rogue-like battle over a set distance through space,
fighting infectious pathogens that start to cause damage
when they come within a certain vicinity of your clone's
ship. When the clone dies, experience is passed on to
the next clone, who now has a better chance to succeed.
It will take multiple clones and deaths to reach the
end boss and defeat it.
